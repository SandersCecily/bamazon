# bamazon

## Description
This application is a command line interface (CLI APP) is like a mini version of Amazon made with a database. The program uses the mySQL package to interact with the schema file and give the user the list of items that bamazon has for sale. A .env file will need to be made to work with your machine for the password in the connection request.

## How It Works / Demo
This CLI application walks the user through what they are trying to accomplish. Refer to the video below to get a better understanding of how it does this.

## Required packages
* .env
* mySQL
* inquirer

## Improvements
I could obviously fleshed out the project by working on the other challenges presented to me but other than that I feel I could have also used a seed.sql file instead of just one schema file to make it more professional. I also feel as though the output could be sharper but I'm unsure of how to achieve that.
